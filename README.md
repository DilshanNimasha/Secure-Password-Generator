# Secure-Password-Generator

In today's world, with the increasing number of online accounts and the growing threat of cyber attacks, having a strong and secure password is more important than ever. Passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access to personal or sensitive information, and the weakest password can compromise entire digital identity.

A secure password generator is a web application tool that automatically creates strong, random
passwords that are difficult for attackers to guess or crack. In this project, designing and
developing a password generator that is easy to use, generates passwords that meet certain
security requirements, and protects users' passwords from being stolen or intercepted.

In this project mainly create two types of password. 
  1. Randomized Password
  2. Memorable Password

The generator should include a password strength meter that informs the user how strong the password is, based on its length and complexity.
