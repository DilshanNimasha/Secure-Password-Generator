# Secure-Password-Generator

In today's world, with the increasing number of online accounts and the growing threat of cyber attacks, having a strong and secure password is more important than ever. Passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access to personal or sensitive information, and the weakest password can compromise entire digital identity.

A secure password generator is a web application tool that automatically creates strong, random passwords that are difficult for attackers to guess or crack. In this project, designing and developing a password generator that is easy to use, generates passwords that meet certain security requirements, and protects users' passwords from being stolen or intercepted.

In this project mainly create two types of password. 
  1. Randomized Password
  2. Memorable Password

The generator should include a password strength meter that informs the user how strong the password is, based on its length and complexity. Typically, a password strength meter will use a color-coded system to indicate the strength of the password. For example, a red color may indicate a weak password, while a green color may indicate a strong password. Some password strength meters may use a numerical scale, such as 0 to 100, to rate the strength of the password.

The strength meter may also provide feedback to the user on how to improve the strength of the password. For example, it may suggest adding more characters, using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, or avoiding common words or phrases.

         1.  Length: The password generator should allow the user to specify the length of the password to be generated. A minimum length of 12 characters is          recommended, but the user may want to generate longer passwords if they have specific security requirements.

         2.  Complexity: The generator should be able to create passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This will make the passwords more complex and difficult to guess or crack.

         3.  Randomness: The generator should be able to create truly random passwords. It should not use predictable patterns or sequences, as this can make the passwords easier to crack.

         4.  Avoiding common passwords: The generator should avoid creating passwords that are commonly used, such as "password" or "123456". It should also avoid using personal information like names, birthdates, or other easily guessable information.

         5.  Strength meter: The generator should include a password strength meter that informs the user how strong the password is, based on its length and complexity.

         6.  User-friendly interface: The generator should have a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for the user to generate and copy the password to their clipboard, without having to remember or type it manually.
